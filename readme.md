# DeMicroFi - Decentralized Micro Finance Loan

DAPP that facilitates Loan Process, no-required third party based on Ethereum Network. It has a mechanism to incentive good behaviour by giving users heart token which can be used to redeem coupon.

## Problem Statement

* Micro financing through blockchain using Algorand can provide a revolutionary solution for refugees who struggle to make a living without proper identification, which makes it difficult for them to access traditional banking services. With Algorand's fast and secure blockchain technology, refugees can obtain micro loans without the need for collateral or a credit history, empowering them to start small businesses and become financially independent. * This innovative approach to financing can significantly improve the lives of refugees and support their journey towards self-sustainability. By deploying Algorand's blockchain, the lending process becomes transparent, secure and highly efficient, enabling lenders and borrowers to transact directly and transparently without the need for intermediaries. This technology also ensures that funds are distributed equitably, without the risk of corruption or misappropriation.
* Overall, micro financing through blockchain using Algorand has the potential to be a powerful tool for social and economic empowerment, enabling refugees to build better lives for themselves and their communities.

## Proposed Solution

The emergence of Blockchain is a key to solve any intermediary-related problem. Lenders and Borrowers can communicate directly, all loan transactions are stored in immutable database.
The comparision of non-Blockchain and Blockchain solution :
| Non-Blockchain | Blockchain |
|----------------|------------|
| Expensive traditional audit process | Small amount of money for gas fee |
| Truthless intermediary company | No need third party |
| Transactions can be manipulated | Tranparent and secure transactions|

## DApp Architecture Design

### Technology

FrontEnd : React.JS, Javascript, Redux, Metamask, ThirdWeb SDK's

Smart Contract : Solidity

On Chain Database : Algorand Blockchain using Algorand's EVM-compatible Layer-2, Milkomeda
Off Chain Database : Firebase

## Data Storage

### On-Chain

- `LoanDB.sol`
  | Name | Type | Structure | Visibility | Purpose |
  |---------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------|
  | `debt` | struct |{ address lender; address borrower;uint256 amountOfDebt;uint256 interest; uint8 loanState;} | N/A | Structure to store debt details |
  | `LoanState` | enum | {REQUESTED, FUNDED, PAID} | N/A | State of loan |
  | `debtInfo` | mapping | (bytes32 debtID=> debt) | private | mapping of debtID with the debt struct |
  | `debtHistory` | mapping | (address borrower => bytes32[] debtID) | private | mapping of borrower with debtID list |
  | `lendHistory` | mapping | (address lender => bytes32[] debtID) | private | mapping of lender with debtID list |
  | `haveDebt` | mapping | (address user => bool haveDebt) | private | checking user is having debt or not |

- `Wallet.sol`
  | Name | Type | Structure | Visibility | Purpose |
  |---------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------|
  | `_deposits`| mapping | (address user => uint256 amount) | private | the amount of money that user has|

### Off-chain

All user information and debt details are stored in Firebase Database.

**/infor**

- name.
- address.
- phone.
- userAddr.

**/debt**

- amount.
- borrower.
- debtNo.
- reason.

**/coupon**

- product.
- productCode.
- userAddr.
